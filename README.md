# What is Whalesync?

### Welcome! We're so glad you're here. ðŸ’™

Whalesync is a no-code integration tool that **connects your SaaS apps with your favorite spreadsheet**.

Without any code, you can start controlling your business tools from flexible, easy-to-use spreadsheets like Airtable, Notion, and Google Sheets.

When your apps are deeply connected to spreadsheets you gain work super powers like the ability to:

* Bulk edit records
* Let anyone on the team make updates without training
* Utilize formulas and AI



These super powers enable powerful use cases like:

* Generate thousands of programmatic SEO pages (Webflow + Airtable)
* Track your sales deals in Notion (HubSpot + Notion)
* Build internal tools (Postgres + Airtable)
* Let investors update deals from a sheet (Affinity + Sheets)



## Whalesync is different from tools like Zapier

Our goal is very specific: create a two-way sync between your spreadsheet and your app.

Workflow automation tools like Zapier solve a different problem: on a trigger, run a series of automations.
