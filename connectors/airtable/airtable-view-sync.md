### About Airtable view sync

[Airtable views](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/202624989-Views-overview) are filtered subsets of the data in Airtable.

With Airtable view sync, you can sync specific views instead of the entire table.

### How to use Airtable view sync

When mapping tables, choose the Airtable view you'd like to sync instead of the entire table.

### Limitations

{% hint style="danger" %}
**If you change your Airtable view, updates will not sync until the next "full sync"**\
Airtable doesn't alert Whalesync if you change your Airtable view configuration, so Whalesync won't sync these changes until the next time it does a "full sync".
{% endhint %}
