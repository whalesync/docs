# Associations

#### TL;DR

* Whalesync supports two-way syncing HubSpot associations :tada:
* In order to two-way sync associations, you'll need to map the field correctly
* You can map associations with foreign keys (i.e. linked records)

#### **Compatible Fields**

Each app calls it something slightly different, but here are the fields that are compatible with HubSpot associations.

| App      | Name          |
| -------- | ------------- |
| HubSpot  | Association   |
| Postgres | Foreign Key   |
| Airtable | Linked Record |
| Notion   | Relation      |
| Webflow  | Reference     |

For a more detailed explanation of how these types of fields work, see :point\_down:

#### **Caveats**

{% hint style="warning" %}
For now, Whalesync is not able to sync associations for custom objects.
