# Memberstack custom fields

Memberstack custom fields are supported differently in their API than other fields. In order to sync custom fields, you need to create a member in Memberstack with the email "schema@whalesync.com".

Once you create that member, add the custom fields you want to sync and **make sure to put values in those fields**.
