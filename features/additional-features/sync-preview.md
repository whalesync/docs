When you set up your sync for the first time, you want to know exactly what will happen when you activate your sync... now you can!

With Sync Preview, you get a look into the changes Whalesync will make during the initial sync.

{% hint style="info" %}
Sync Preview is available any time Whalesync is going to kick off an "initial sync".\
\
An initial sync is necessary when:

* you set up a sync for the first time
* you add a new table mapping to a sync
* you change the filters on a sync
{% endhint %}
