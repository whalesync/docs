# FAQ

## Why do we no longer offer these connectors?

Whalesync is a flexible tool and every API has its own challenges. When we launch a new connector, we don't always know the full extent of which kinds of sync pairs will be set up, what all of the use cases will be, the record sync volume, and speed requirements for those syncs.

Over time, we sometimes discover that a particular connector is not delivering a best-in-class experience. We hold ourselves to a high standard, so if we don't see a good path to improving the experience, we decide to retire a connector.

## If I have a sync with one of these connectors, will it keep working?

Yes, your existing syncs will stay active and will continue to run as they always have. However, because the connector is retired, future improvements, bug fixes, and support will be limited.

## If I'm using one of these connectors, do I need to migrate to another platform?

That's 100% up to you and depends on your situation. Your syncs will remain active and if they're working well for you, then that's great, no need to switch. However if they're not meeting your needs, please reach out to [support@whalesync.com](mailto:support@whalesync.com) and we can recommend alternatives.

## If I'm on a yearly plan and I move my sync with a retired connector away from Whalesync, can I get a refund?

You can request a plan cancellation and get a refund for the remaining time on your subscription if your situation meets all of the following conditions:

- You're on a yearly subscription plan
- You have a sync with a retired connector
- You delete your syncs using the retired connector

Just reach out to [support@whalesync.com](mailto:support@whalesync.com) and we'll be happy to help.
