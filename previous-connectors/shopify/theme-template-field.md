# Theme Template field

**TL;DR**

* Shopify's Theme Template field works with 2-way sync BUT you must enter in the value exactly in your connected app

**Detailed Explanation**

Whalesync supports two-way sync of Shopify's Theme Template as shown below:

But if you update Theme template in Airtable, you must make sure to input the exact value for a theme that is available in Shopify. If you enter in a value incorrectly, nothing will happen:
