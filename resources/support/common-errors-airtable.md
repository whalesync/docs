# Common errors - Airtable

### 1) "**You have reached the maximum access authorizations for this integration"**

This is an Airtable limitation that occurs during authorization and looks like this:

### 2) "Field 'slug': Unique value is already in database"

Other apps you might connect to Airtable (eg. Webflow) will often have a requirement that the `slug`field is unique.

<mark style="color:green;">**Suggested Action:**</mark>

1. We suggest using an Airtable formula to create slugs:

{% content-ref url="how-to-create-a-slug-field-in-airtable.md" %}
[how-to-create-a-slug-field-in-airtable.md](how-to-create-a-slug-field-in-airtable.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### 3) "Airtable doesn't allow you to create records in their native "synced" tables."

Airtable has a native syncing feature called "[synced tables](https://support.airtable.com/docs/getting-started-with-airtable-sync)" that pulls data into an Airtable base.

You'll notice a little lightning bolt like this when using their synced tables feature:

When using an Airtable synced table, **Airtable does not allow you to overwrite this data**. So if you set up a Whalesync 2-way sync, you will hit Airtable sync issues.

**How to Resolve**

* Either make this a 1-way sync to only sync data _out_ of the Airtable synced table
* OR switch the table in Airtable to a normal "non-synced" table

### 4) "Invalid user permissions in Airtable."

Airtable is blocking Whalesync from making changes to your Airtable base due to permissions settings in Airtable.

**How to Resolve**

1.  Go to your Airtable base and check the permissions of the user you authorized with

2.  Check permissions in your Airtable Workspace settings

    a. Confirm that your user has the ability to create and edit the Airtable base you authorized.
3.  Check your Airtable Workspace sharing restrictions
