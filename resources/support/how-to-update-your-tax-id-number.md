# How to update your tax ID number

If you're a business, you can update your tax ID number in Whalesync's billing portal. You may need this if you are in a country where businesses are not normally charged VAT, such as the EU.

To do this:

1. Go to the [Whalesync dashboard](https://app.whalesync.com)
2. Click [_Manage subscription_](https://app.whalesync.com/subscription/manage)
3. Under _Billing information_, click _Update information_
